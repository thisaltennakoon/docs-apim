# Configuring a Distributed API-M Deployment with Traffic Manager Separated from the Control Plane

The WSO2 API-M server can be deployed as an [all-in-one deployment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/single-node/all-in-one-deployment-overview) or as a distributed deployment. In the distributed setup, the [API-M server profiles]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/distributed-deployment/product-profiles) are deployed as separate API-M nodes. 

Given below are the API-M nodes you can have in a distributed deployment.

!!! Tip
    To enable high availability, you need a minimum of two nodes running each profile.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            API-M Node (Profile)
        </th>
        <th>
            Description
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Gateway Worker Node
        </td>
        <td>
            API-M nodes running the Gateway profile.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Control Plane Node
        </td>
        <td>
            API-M nodes running the Control Plane profile. The Control Plane includes the Traffic Manager, Key Manager, Publisher, and Developer Portal components.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Traffic Manager Node (Optional)
        </td>
        <td>
            If required you can configure a separate API-M node to run the Traffic Manager component. That is, the Control Plane nodes run the Key Manager, Publisher, and Developer Portal, while the Traffic Manager runs on a separate node.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
