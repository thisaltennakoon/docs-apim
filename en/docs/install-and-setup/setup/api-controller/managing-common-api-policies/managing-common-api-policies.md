# Managing common API Policies

Following actions on common API Policies are allowed by apictl.

1. List common API Policies in an environment.
2. Export a common API Policy in an environment.
3. Import a common API Policy to an environment.
4. Delete a common API Policy in an environment.

## Add common API Policies in an environment

You can add common API Policies via the Publisher Portal. For more information, see [Create API Policy via Publisher Portal]({{base_path}}/manage-apis/design/api-policies/create-policy).
However, **WSO2 API Controller (apictl)** allows you to create API Policies without using the Publisher Portal.

## Get common API Policies in an environment

Follow the instructions below to display a list of common API Policies in an environment using apictl:

1.  Make sure that the WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M) is started and that the relevant version of apictl is set up.   
     For more information, see [Download and Initialize the apictl]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/api-controller/getting-started-with-wso2-api-controller/#download-and-initialize-the-apictl).
2.  Log in to the WSO2 API-M in the environment by following the instructions in [Login to an Environment]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/api-controller/getting-started-with-wso2-api-controller/#login-to-an-environment).
3.  Run the corresponding apictl command below to get (list) common API Policies in an environment.

        -   **Command**
            ``` bash
            apictl get policies api -e <environment>
            ```

            apictl get policies api --environment <environment>
            ```
            ``` bash

            ```

            !!! info
                **Flags:**  
                
                -   Required :  
                    `--environment` or `-e` : Environment to be searched   
                -   Optional :   
                    `--all`: All common API Policies available in the environment   
                    `--limit` or `-l` : Maximum number of common API Policies to return (Default 25)   
                    `--format` : pretty-print common API Policies using Go templates   

            !!!note
                When executing the `apictl get policies api` command, using both the `--all` and `--limit` flags at once is not allowed.

            !!! example
                ```bash
                apictl get policies api -e dev 
                ```
                ```bash
                apictl get policies api --environment production --limit 15 
                ```    
                ```bash
                apictl get policies api --environment production

            !!! tip 
                When using the `get policies api` command, `--all` optional flag can be used to 
                get all available common API Policies.

            !!!note
                Output of the `get policies api` command can be formatted with Go Templates. For more information on formatting the get commands, see [Formatting the outputs of get commands]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/api-controller/advanced-topics/formatting-the-output-of-get-command).
