# Create a GraphQL API

GraphQL, which has been developed by Facebook, is a data query language for APIs. When using GraphQL, users can explicitly specify as to what data they need from an API. GraphQL APIs are an alternative to REST-based APIs. 

You can use a Schema Definition Language (SDL) schema to design a GraphQL API in WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M) similar to creating SOAP APIs using WSDLs and developing REST APIs using OpenAPI Specifications (a.k.a. Swagger Definitions).

All GraphQL schemas generally have three operation root types, which are namely query, mutation, and subscription. Therefore, every request against a GraphQL endpoint of a GraphQL server should have a payload starting with any one of the root types, including its related operation name. You can manage the security, authorization, and rate limiting aspect of each operation based on its operation name. 

!!! note
    GraphQL client supports only `graphql-transport-ws` protocol but the Gateway supports both the `graphql-transport-ws` and `graphql-ws` protocols.

Follow the instructions below to design a GraphQL API.

!!! note
    For more information on the payload, see [GraphQL operations](#graphql-operations).

Now, you have successfully created and configured a GraphQL API. 

Next, let's deploy your API in the [WSO2 API Gateway]({{base_path}}/manage-apis/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/deploy-api/deploy-an-api/) and [Publish your API]({{base_path}}/manage-apis/deploy-and-publish/publish-on-dev-portal/publish-an-api/).

### GraphQL operations

The following sub-sections explain as to how authorization, security, and throttling affect API operations.

#### Authorization for GraphQL operations
A scope acts as a limiting factor on what API resources can be accessed using an access token and thereby defines the authorization aspect for API requests.

- **Authorization for a single operation**

    When a query has a single operation, the access token should include the scope that is attached to that specific operation to be able to invoke the API.

- **Authorization for multiple operations**
 
    When a query has multiple operations, the access token should include all the scopes that are attached to the operations that correspond to that specific API to be able to invoke the API.

#### Security for GraphQL operations
Security can be enabled or disabled for GraphQL operations. Security is enabled for GraphQL operations by default.

- **Security for a single operation**

    When a query has an operation that has security enabled, the users need to enter their credentials to invoke the respective API. However, when security is disabled for the operation, the users can invoke the respective API without entering their credentials.

- **Security for multiple operations**
  
    The API request takes into consideration the security configurations of all the operations that belong to the API. When a query has security enabled for one of the operations that belong to a specific API, then security is automatically applied for all the operations. Therefore, in such cases, users have to use their credentials when invoking that respective API.

#### Rate limiting for GraphQL operations
Rate limiting is set to unlimited, and thereby disabled by default. 

- **Rate limiting for a single operation**

    When a query has an operation with a rate limiting policy applied to it, the respective rate limiting policy is taken into account to rate limit the request when it exceeds the desired limit. 

- **Rate limiting for multiple operations**

    WSO2 API Manager checks all the operation related rate limiting policies when determining the overall rate limit. When the requests exceed the minimum rate limit, which corresponds to the operations in the query, they will be throttled out.
