    !!! note
          HTTP transport will be disabled for an API if it has Mutual SSL enabled.

4.  Click **Add Certificate** to upload a new client certificate.
    
    !!! note
        This feature currently supports only the `.crt` format for certificates.

        If you need to use a certificate in any other format, you can convert it using a standard tool before uploading it.


5.  Provide an alias and public certificate. Select the tier that should be used to throttle out the calls using this particular client certificate and click **Upload**.
