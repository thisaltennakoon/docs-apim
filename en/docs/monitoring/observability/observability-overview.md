# Observability Overview

Observability can be viewed as a superset of monitoring where monitoring is enriched with capabilities to perform debugging and profiling through rich context, log analysis, correlation, and tracing. Modern day observability resides on three pillars of **logs**, **metrics**, and **tracing**. Modern businesses require observability systems to self-sufficiently emit their current state (overview), generate alerts for any abnormalities detected to proactively identify failures, and to provide information to find the root causes of a system failure.

The API Manager observability solution allows you to monitor the requests and the responses that correspond to a specific API call, monitor your application's usage, monitor production servers, enable distributed tracing and monitor API Manager via the JConsole tool.
