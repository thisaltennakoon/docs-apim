# HTTP Status Codes

When REST API requests are sent to carry out various actions, various HTTP status codes will be returned based on the state of the action (success or failure) and the HTTP method (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) executed. The following are the definitions of the various HTTP status codes that are returned.
