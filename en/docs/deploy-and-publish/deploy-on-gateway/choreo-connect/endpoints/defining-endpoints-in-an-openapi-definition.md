# Defining Endpoints in an OpenAPI Definition

You can use an existing OpenAPI definition to create an API project using APICTL, and deploy that project directly to Choreo Connect. When following this path, the endpoints must be included in the OpenAPI definition itself, so that the inbound request of Choreo Connect can be routed to the corresponding backend service. You, as a developer, can state the endpoint URLs for, 

- the whole API or 
- a particular resource 

depending on the requirement. In addition, you can state the corresponding environment (i.e., production or sandbox) as well.

### API Level Endpoints

It is mandatory for you to define the API Level endpoint at the root level of your OpenAPI definition at the design time. However, if you have defined resource level endpoints for all the resources, then defining an API Level endpoint is not necessary. For resources without a specific endpoint, the inbound traffic is automatically routed to the provided API level endpoint.

=== "Format"
    ``` yaml
    .
    .
    info:
    .
    .
    x-wso2-basePath: <base_path>
    x-wso2-production-endpoints:
        urls: 
        - <API_level_endpoint>
    x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
        urls:
        - <API_level_endpoint>
    security:
    - petstore_auth : []
    ```

=== "Example"
    ``` yaml
    .
    .
    info:
    version: 1.0.5
    title: PizzaShackAPI
    x-wso2-basePath: /v2
    x-wso2-production-endpoints:
        urls: 
        - https://localhost:2380/v2
    x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
        urls:
        - https://localhost:2380/v2
    security:
    - petstore_auth : []

    ```

### Resource Level Endpoints

In Choreo Connect, you can define different endpoint URLs for different resources within the same OpenAPI definition. Defining an endpoint under a resource in the OpenAPI definition, will make the endpoint a resource level endpoint. When the traffic comes in for a particular resource, it will be routed based on the endpoint configuration under the resource, and not according to the API level endpoint configuration.

=== "Format"
    ``` yaml
    .
    .
    info:
    .
    .
    x-wso2-basePath: 
    x-wso2-production-endpoints:
        urls:
        - 
    paths:
        /pet/findByStatus:
            x-wso2-production-endpoints:
                urls:
                - 
            x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
                urls:
                -
            get:
        /pet/{petId}:
            get:
    .
    . 
    ```

=== "Example"
    ``` yaml
    .
    .
    info:
    .
    .
    x-wso2-basePath: 
    x-wso2-production-endpoints:
        urls:
        - 
    paths:
        /pet/findByStatus:
            x-wso2-production-endpoints:
                urls:
                -  https://localhost:2380/v1 
            get:
                tags:
                - pets
                summary: Finds Pets by status
                description: Multiple status values can be provided with comma separated strings
                operationId: findPetsByStatus
                parameters:
                - name: status
                in: query
                description: Status values that need to be considered for filter
            .
            .
        /pet/{petId}:
            get:
    .
    .
    ```

In the above example `/pet/findByStatus` resource has a separate endpoint configuration compared to the `/pet/{petId}` resource. Therefore, the inbound traffic for the `/pet/findByStatus` resource are routed based on its specific endpoint object, whereas the requests coming to the `/pet/{petId}` resource are routed to the API Level endpoint.

### Production and Sandbox Endpoints

Choreo Connect supports Production and Sandbox endpoints at both the API level and resource level. You can define two completely different endpoints with different host addresses, ports, and basepaths as the production and sandbox endpoints for a particular API/resource.

=== "Format"
    ``` yaml
    .
    .
    info:
    .
    .
    x-wso2-basePath: <base_path>
    x-wso2-production-endpoints:
        urls: 
        - <API_level_endpoint>
    x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
        urls:
        - <API_level_endpoint>
    security:
    - petstore_auth : []
    ```

=== "Example"
    ``` yaml
    .
    .
    info:
    version: 1.0.5
    title: PizzaShackAPI
    x-wso2-basePath: /v2
    x-wso2-production-endpoints:
        urls: 
        - https://localhost:2380/v2/prod
    x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
        urls:
        - https://localhost:2381/v2/sand
    security:
    - petstore_auth : []

    ```

!!! info

        - If a resource level production endpoint is provided but no resource level sandbox endpoint is provided, Choreo Connect will use the API level sandbox endpoint as the resource level sandbox endpoint for that particular resource.

        In the following example, `https://localhost:2380/v1` will be used as the production level endpoint and `https://localhost:2381/v2/sand` will be used as the sandbox level endpoint for the resource `/pet/findByStatus`.

        === "Example"
            ``` yaml
            .
            .
            info:
            .
            .
            x-wso2-basePath: 
            x-wso2-production-endpoints:
                urls: 
                - https://localhost:2380/v2/prod
            x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
                urls:
                - https://localhost:2381/v2/sand
            paths:
                /pet/findByStatus:
                    x-wso2-production-endpoints:
                        urls:
                        -  https://localhost:2380/v1
                    get:
                        tags:
                        - pets
                        summary: Finds Pets by status
                        description: Multiple status values can be provided with comma separated strings
                        operationId: findPetsByStatus
                        parameters:
                        - name: status
                        in: query
                        description: Status values that need to be considered for filter
                    .
                    .
            ```

        - If a resource level sandbox endpoint is provided but no resource level production endpoint is provided, Choreo Connect will use the API level production endpoint as the resource level production endpoint for that particular resource.

        In the following example, `https://localhost:2380/v1` will be used as the sandbox level endpoint and `https://localhost:2381/v2/prod` will be used as the production level endpoint for the resource `/pet/findByStatus`.

        === "Example"
            ``` yaml
            .
            .
            info:
            .
            .
            x-wso2-basePath: 
            x-wso2-production-endpoints:
                urls: 
                - https://localhost:2380/v2/prod
            x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
                urls:
                - https://localhost:2381/v2/sand
            paths:
                /pet/findByStatus:
                    x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints:
                        urls:
                        -  https://localhost:2380/v1
                    get:
                        tags:
                        - pets
                        summary: Finds Pets by status
                        description: Multiple status values can be provided with comma separated strings
                        operationId: findPetsByStatus
                        parameters:
                        - name: status
                        in: query
                        description: Status values that need to be considered for filter
                    .
                    .
            ```


### Endpoint Objects

An endpoint can either belong to a production environment or sandbox environment. Therefore, an endpoint is listed under the extension ` x-wso2-production-endpoints` or `x-wso2-sandbox-endpoints` accordingly.

The following is the basic structure of an endpoint.

``` yaml
x-wso2-production-endpoints:
    urls:
    - <endpoint_URL>
```

The purpose of URLs field is to include the backend service URLs.

If you have added resource level endpoints and you have repeated the same endpoint in multiple resources, it will cause data duplication in the OpenAPI definition. In order to avoid repetition, the endpoints can be provided under a reference model as shown below. 

=== "Format"
    ``` yaml
    paths:
        /pet/findByStatus:
            x-wso2-production-endpoints: "#/x-wso2-endpoints/<endpoint-name>"
            get:
                tags:
                - 
                summary: 
                description: 
                operationId: 
    .
    .
    x-wso2-endpoints:
    - myEndpoint:
        urls:
        - <endpoint-URL-1>
        - <endpoint-URL-2>
    ```

=== "Example"
    ``` yaml
    paths:
        /pet/findByStatus:
            x-wso2-production-endpoints: "#/x-wso2-endpoints/myEndpoint1"
            get:
                tags:
                - pet
                summary: Finds Pets by status
                description: Multiple status values can be provided with comma separated strings
                operationId: findPetsByStatus
    .
    .
    x-wso2-endpoints:
    - myEndpoint1:
        urls:
        - https://localhost:2380/v1
    - myEndpoint2:
        urls:
        - https://localhost:2380/v2
    - myEndpoint3:
        urls:
        - https://localhost:2380/v1
        - https://localhost:2380/v2
        - myEndpoint4:
    ```
