# Deploying Choreo Connect as a Standalone Gateway on Docker Compose

Let's deploy an API in Choreo Connect running on Docker Compose as a Standalone Gateway. We can use [WSO2 API Controller (apictl)]({{base_path}}/reference/apictl/wso2-api-controller/) the Command Line Tool to deploy the API.

!!! info "Before you begin"

    Install and set up [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Step 1 - Download and setup the Choreo Connect distribution and apictl

1. Download and install apictl

    apictl is a CLI tool that can be used to deploy and undeploy APIs in the Choreo Connect clusters. Refer [Download and initialize the CTL Tool]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/api-controller/getting-started-with-wso2-api-controller/#download-and-initialize-the-ctl-tool) to setup apictl in your development environment.

2. Download and extract the Choreo Connect distribution .zip file

    The latest Choreo Connect distribution can be downloaded from [https://wso2.com/choreo/choreo-connect/](https://wso2.com/choreo/choreo-connect/). Let's extract the Choreo Connect distribution .zip file and refer to the extracted location as `<CHOREO-CONNECT_HOME>` hereafter.

## Step 2 - Initialize an API project

Navigate to a preferred workspace folder using the command line. Run the following command to create an API project named "petstore". This creates the folder structure for the artifacts to be included. Use the --oas option as given below to create an API project based on an OpenAPI definition.

```shell
apictl init petstore --oas <api definition path>
```

Let's use the [Petstore sample OpenAPI definition](https://petstore.swagger.io/)

```shell
apictl init petstore --oas https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json
```

The project is now initialized. A directory with the name "petstore" has been created.

!!! note
        The folder structure is similar to the following.

    ```java
    petstore
    ├── Client-certificates
    ├── Definitions
    │   └── swagger.yaml
    ├── Docs
    ├── Endpoint-certificates
    ├── Image
    ├── Interceptors
    ├── README.md
    ├── Sequences
    │   ├── fault-sequence
    │   ├── in-sequence
    │   └── out-sequence
    ├── api.yaml
    ├── api_meta.yaml
    └── libs
    ```

!!! info
    For more information on the API project directory that gets created, see [Getting Started with apictl]({{base_path}}/install-and-setup/setup/api-controller/getting-started-with-wso2-api-controller).

## Step 3 - Start Choreo Connect

Start Choreo Connect on Docker Compose by executing the Docker Compose script inside the extracted distribution folder by navigating to `<CHOREO-CONNECT_HOME>/docker-compose/choreo-connect/` and executing the following command.

``` java
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the containers are up and running, we can monitor the status of the containers using the following command.
    ``` java
    docker ps | grep choreo-connect-
    ```

## Step 4 - Deploy the API Project

1. Add the Choreo Connect Cluster as an Environment to apictl

    To use apictl with Choreo Connect, we need to add the Choreo Connect cluster as an environment to apictl.
    Basically, the adapter URL will be added as the Gateway environment, and the added environment can be used in the subsequent commands.

    === "Format"
        ``` shell
        apictl mg add env <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> --adapter <ADAPTER_URL>
        ```

    === "Example"
        ``` shell
        apictl mg add env dev --adapter https://localhost:9843
        ```

2. Log in to the Choreo Connect Cluster

    Next you need to log in to the Choreo Connect environment (log in to the adapter) in order to deploy the API in Choreo Connect.

    === "Format"
        ``` shell
        apictl mg login dev -u <AUTHORIZED_USER_USERNAME> -p <USER_PASSWORD> -k
        ```

    === "Example"
        ``` shell
        apictl mg login dev -u admin -p admin -k
        ```

    !!! info
        The following apictl commands are executed with the flag `-k` to avoid the SSL verification with Choreo Connect. To communicate via HTTPS without skipping the SSL verification (without -k flag), add the cert of Choreo Connect into `/home/<your-pc-username>/.wso2apictl/certs`.

3. Deploy the API in Choreo Connect

    Now let's deploy our first API to Choreo Connect using the project created in the step 3. Navigate to the location where the petstore project was initialized. Execute the following command to deploy the API in Choreo Connect.

    === "Format"
        ``` shell
        apictl mg deploy api -f <PROJRECT_NAME> -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> -k
        ```

    === "Example"
        ``` shell
        apictl mg deploy api -f petstore -e dev -k
        ```

## Step 5 - Invoke the sample API

1. Obtain a token

    After the APIs are exposed via WSO2 Choreo Connect, you can invoke an API with a valid access token (JWT) or using a test key.  
    Let's use WSO2 Choreo Connect's test key endpoint to obtain a test key in order to access the API. Refer [Generate a Test JWT]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/security/generate-a-test-jwt) for more details.

    === "Sample Token"
        ``` shell
        TOKEN=$(curl -X POST "https://localhost:9095/testkey" -d "scope=read:pets" -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -k -v)
        ```

    !!! info
        You can obtain a JWT token from any third-party secure token service or via WSO2 API Manager, that is configured as an issuer in Choreo Connect.

2. Invoke the API

    Execute the following command to Invoke the API using the test key. You can now invoke the API running on Choreo Connect using the following cURL command.

    === "Format"
        ``` shell
        curl -X GET "<Docker-hostname>:<Docker-port>/<API-context>/<API-resource>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -k
        ```

    === "Example"
        ``` shell
        curl -X GET "https://localhost:9095/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN" -k
        ```
