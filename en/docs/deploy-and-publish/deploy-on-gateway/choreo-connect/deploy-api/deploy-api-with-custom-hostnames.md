# Exposing APIs With Custom Hostnames in Choreo Connect Using WSO2 API Manager

You can expose APIs with custom hostnames in the following ways depending on the Choreo Connect **mode** you have chosen.

## Via WSO2 API Manager Publisher Portal

Follow the instructions below to use Choreo Connect with WSO2 API Manager as the Control Plane to expose APIs with custom hostnames via the Publisher Portal in WSO2 API Manager:

!!! info
    **Before you begin**

    This guide assumes that you already have a Choreo Connect instance that is up and running. If not, checkout the [Quick Start Guide]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/getting-started/quick-start-guide-docker-with-apim) on how to install and run Choreo Connect. To learn more about Choreo Connect, have a look at the [Overview of Choreo Connect]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/getting-started/choreo-connect-overview).

### Step 1 - Define Virtual Hosts

Let's define virtual hosts (VHosts) in API Manager server instance by editing the `deployment.toml`.

!!! info
    Refer [Define Custom Hostnames]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/deploy-api/exposing-apis-via-custom-hostnames/#step-1-define-the-custom-hostnames)
    for more information.

1. Open `<APIM-HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml` file.
2. Add the following configuration under the **Default** `[[apim.gateway.environment]]` to define the VHost `us.wso2.com`.
    ```toml
    [[apim.gateway.environment.virtual_host]]
    ws_endpoint = "ws://us.wso2.com:9099"
    wss_endpoint = "wss://us.wso2.com:8099"
    http_endpoint = "http://us.wso2.com/gateway"
    https_endpoint = "https://us.wso2.com/gateway"
    websub_event_receiver_http_endpoint = "http://us.wso2.com:9021"
    websub_event_receiver_https_endpoint = "https://us.wso2.com:8021"
    ``` 
### Step 2 - Configure Choreo Connect with API Manager

Refer to [documentation on how to configure Choreo Connect with API Manager]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/getting-started/deploy/cc-on-docker-with-apim-as-control-plane).

### Step 3 - Create an API in API Manager

Follow the steps [here]({{base_path}}/design/create-api/create-rest-api/create-a-rest-api-from-an-openapi-definition/).

### Step 4 - Deploy the API in API Manager

The guide [here]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/deploy-api/deploy-an-api) will explain how you can easily deploy the API you just created.
When deploying the API, select the Virtual Host you defined earlier (i.e. `us.wso2.com`).

You have successfully deployed the API to Choreo Connect with the VHost `us.wso2.com`.

To invoke the API, skip to the steps [here](#invoke-the-api).

### Step 5 - Invoke the API

First we need to add the host entry to `/etc/hosts` file in order to access the API Manager publisher and Developer Portal.
Add the following entry to `/etc/hosts` file

```sh
127.0.0.1   us.wso2.com
```

{! ./includes/obtain-jwt.md !}

Execute the following cURL command to Invoke the API using the JWT.

```sh
curl -X GET "https://us.wso2.com:9095/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available" -H "accept: application/xml" -H "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN" -k
```

!!! note
    You can also use header to specify the VHost to invoke the API.
    ```sh
    curl -X GET "https://localhost:9095/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available" \
        -H "Host: us.wso2.com"
        -H "accept: application/xml" \
        -H "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN" -k
    ```

## Via apictl for Standalone Mode

Follow the instructions below to use Choreo Connect as a Standalone Gateway to expose APIs with custom hostnames via WSO2 API Controller (apictl), which is a CLI Tool:

!!! info
    **Before you begin**

    This guide assumes that you already have a Choreo Connect instance that is up and running. If not, checkout the [Quick Start Guide]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/getting-started/deploy/cc-as-a-standalone-gateway-on-docker) on how to install and run Choreo Connect. To learn more about Choreo Connect, have a look at the [Overview of Choreo Connect]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/getting-started/choreo-connect-overview).

### Step 1 - Define Virtual Hosts

Navigate to the `deployment_environments.yaml` file and define the virtual hosts as shown below.

```yaml
type: deployment_environments
version: v4.2.0
data:
 -
   displayOnDevportal: true
   deploymentEnvironment: Default
   deploymentVhost: us.wso2.com
```

!!! info
    When configuring multiple Choreo Connect Gateway environments, you have to configure the default VHost of the particular environment.
    
    === "Format"
        ```toml
        # default vhosts mapping for standalone mode
        [[adapter.vhostMapping]]
          environment = <ENVIRONMENT_NAME>
          vhost = <DEFAULT_VHOST_OF_ENVIRONMENT>
        ```
    
    === "Example"
        ```toml
        # default vhosts mapping for standalone mode
        [[adapter.vhostMapping]]
          environment = "Default"
          vhost = "localhost"
        [[adapter.vhostMapping]]
          environment = "sg-region"
          vhost = "sg.wso2.com"
        ```
    
    If the VHost is not declared in the API project, the API is deployed with the default VHost of the environment.
    For exammple, an API project with following `deployment_environments.yaml` will be deployed to the following.
    - Environment: Default - Vhost: us.wso2.com
    - Environment: sg-region - Vhost: sg.wso2.com
    - Environment: uk-region - API is not deployed to this environment becuase it is not configured in `[[adapter.vhostMapping]]`.
    
    ```yaml
    type: deployment_environments
    version: v4.2.0
    data:
     -
       displayOnDevportal: true
       deploymentEnvironment: Default
       deploymentVhost: us.wso2.com
     -
       displayOnDevportal: true
       deploymentEnvironment: sg-region
     -
       displayOnDevportal: true
       deploymentEnvironment: uk-region
    ```

### Step 2 - Deploy the API

Follow the all steps up to **Deploy API** in the [Deploy an API via apictl documentation]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/deploy-api/deploy-rest-api-in-choreo-connect/#choreo-connect-as-a-standalone-gateway).

Let's invoke the API.

### Step 3 - Invoke the API

First we need to add the host entry to `/etc/hosts` file in order to access the API Manager publisher and Developer Portal.

Add the following entry to `/etc/hosts` file

```sh
127.0.0.1   us.wso2.com
```

{! ./includes/obtain-jwt.md !}

Execute the following cURL command to Invoke the API using the JWT.

```sh
curl -X GET "https://us.wso2.com:9095/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available" -H "accept: application/xml" -H "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN" -k
```

!!! note
    You can also use header to specify the VHost to invoke the API.
    ```sh
    curl -X GET "https://localhost:9095/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available" \
        -H "Host: us.wso2.com"
        -H "accept: application/xml" \
        -H "Authorization:Bearer $TOKEN" -k
    ```
