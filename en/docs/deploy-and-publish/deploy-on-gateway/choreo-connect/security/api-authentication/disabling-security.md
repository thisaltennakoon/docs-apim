# Disabling Security for APIs

An API can be invoked without authentication by disabling security. Pick one of the following methods to disable security depending on the Choreo Connect **mode** you have chosen.

|[Choreo Connect with WSO2 API Manager as a Control Plane]({{base_path}}/deploy-and-publish/deploy-on-gateway/choreo-connect/concepts/apim-as-control-plane/)   | [Via WSO2 API Manager Publisher Portal](#via-wso2-api-manager-publisher-portal)  |

## Via WSO2 API Manager Publisher Portal

Follow the steps given in [Disabling Security for APIs]({{base_path}}/design/api-security/api-authentication/disable-security/).

## By updating the OpenAPI definition

APIs can be exposed without requiring any authentication (i.e. disable transport security and application security) using the OpenAPI extension `x-wso2-disable-security` . This extension is supported at API, resource, and operation levels. The following is an example of how you can disable security for an API.

=== "API Level"
    ``` yaml
    openapi: 3.0.0
    info:
      version: 1.0.0
      title: Petstore
    x-wso2-disable-security: true
      paths:
        "/pet/findByStatus":
          get:
    ```

=== "Resource Level"
    ``` yaml
    paths:
    "/pet/findByStatus":
        x-wso2-disable-security: true
        get:
          tags:
          - pet
          summary: Finds Pets by status
          description: Multiple status values can be provided with comma separated strings
          operationId: findPetsByStatus
    ```

=== "Operation Level"
    ``` yaml
    paths:
    "/pet/findByStatus":
        get:
          x-wso2-disable-security: true
          tags:
          - pet
          summary: Finds Pets by status
          description: Multiple status values can be provided with comma separated strings
          operationId: findPetsByStatus
    ```
